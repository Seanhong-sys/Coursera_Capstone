    "\n",
    "In this capstone project, I will try to find what establishments are closest to bank locations. Hypothetically, banks would be found in areas where they can provide banking services to a good number of people enough to stay profitable. Factors for choosing a location would depend on each individual bank company's ability to scale, their number of clients, and even the presence of other banks, in what is known as game theory in economics. Less-known, however, is the connection of the banks branches' physical location with those of nearby establishments. Do these establishments tend cluster in the retail industry? In coffee or other refreshment services? How about other banks themselves? And given information on these types of establishments, can they be used to predict which cluster a particular bank branch belongs to? This notebook will examine such questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have chosen the city of Edmonton in the Canadian province of Alberta as a case study. Edmonton is Canada's sixth largest city with a population of over 1.3 million. Its urban landscape is distinctly suburban and has a decent-sized downtown. Edmonton is home to a fairly robust banking industry and houses the Canadian Western Bank, the only publicly traded Schedule I chartered bank headquarters west of Toronto. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will examine specifically what the most common venues situated near banks are, as well as their corresponding venue category. The primary stakeholders of this capstone project are multitude: it will benefit Edmonton's urban planning department, business investors, and even the banking companies by providing useful insight into the businesses that cluster around banks, including but not limited to:\n",
    "* Which banks are clustered around each other\n",
    "* The types of establishments that are located near banks\n",
    "* Relation between a specified bank cluster and the most common establishments that operate within said cluster\n"

    "To retrieve the banks' addresses in Edmonton, I will refer to BankChart.ca for information from the site:\n",
    "https://bankchart.ca/catalogue/branches/3. Two variables are of particular interest:\n",
    "* Bank name\n",
    "* Addresses of the bank branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the relevant data is stored in a dataframe, the following will be performed:\n",
    "* The approximate locations of each branch's address will be retrieved using **Google Maps API reverse geocoding**.\n",
    "* Information on the venue category of the establishments will be collected using  **Foursquare API**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This should provide the necessary data ripe for answering our business problem, upon which the results will be reviewed for drawing useful conclusions."

    "## Overall Results and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "From the results, it was observed that 'Coffee Shop' is the most common type of establishment that is located close to Edmonton banks, at around 15%. This was followed by 'Fast Food Restaurant' and 'Bank', which came at 11% and 7% respectively. In fact, the top five venue categories (excluding bank) involved sit-down dining establishments and collectively account for almost half of establishments that are closest to banks.\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing the clustering analysis, it was found that the sizes of the clusters were very uneven, with the cluster label '1' being almost as large as the other clusters combined. In fact, the smallest clusters, '3', and ‘1’ had a population of one, that is, only one bank location was found to belong to this cluster, which suggests that these data points are an outliers. The clustering analysis showed that in Edmonton, there were two a main nodes (representing clusters 1 and 4) for which most banks were located. As these specific clusters accounted for almost all of the locations in our database, it can be said that these nodes play an outsized role in banking services in Edmonton or at least, that these nodes are the most representative of the venue categories that are situated near banks. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Two classification methods, Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbours, were performed to predict the cluster labels given the top three most common venues as the independent variables that form the framework of the hypothesized analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic regression analysis that was performed resulted in a Jaccard Similarity Score of 0.533 and an F-1 score of 0.371. Whearas the K-Nearest Neighbours resulted in a Jaccard Similarity Score of 0.533 and an F-1 score of 0.419. This suggests that the K-Nearest Neighbours is better suited than logistic regression to predict the cluster labels given the data we have on the most common venues as provided by Foursquare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using K-Nearest Neighbours as our algorithm in classifying venue categories and bank clusters, we can expect to get our predictions right more than half of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of this project provides further insight into the methodology of assigning clusters following the theory of 'neighborhood characteristics'. Narrowing down the criteria for selecting which venue category to include (and exclude), and performing other classification techniques, are possible avenues for further refinement of the methodology.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly-speaking, the purposes of this project was multifold:\n",
    "* To segment the banks into clusters by location\n",
    "* To observe the most common types of businesses that tend to be established nearby banks and,\n",
    "* To determine whether specific characteristic of a bank's neighborhood can accurately predict the bank's cluster\n",
    "From retrieving the coordinates of the banks' addresses, we were able to generate a 'neighborhood picture' of each bank index using Foursquare data. Then, using clustering analysis, assigned the banks a cluster label from 0 to 4, representing five clusters in total. Using the first index as an example, we could say that:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bank of Montreal, located at 208 KINGSWAY MALL, EDMONTON, AB T5G3A6 with the neighbourhood description: \"Fast Food Restaurant\", Coffee Shop\", and \"Clothing Store\", belongs to **Cluster 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we were able to build a decent classification model using the K-Nearest Neighbours method to predict the cluster labels given the generated 'neighbourhood picture'.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, the main stakeholders that will benefit from this project are Edmonton's urban planning department, investors, and even the bank companies themselves. Inasmuch as they learn what types of establishments are located near banks, decisions on how land in Edmonton should be zoned, what businesses (e.g. coffee shops, clothing stores) are suited to be located nearby banks, and where the banks ideally should expand their footprint are all decisions that this study will help in facilitating.\n"
